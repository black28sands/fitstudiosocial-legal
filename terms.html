        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Other Platform Integrations</h3>

        <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Disclosure</h3>
        <p>FitStudioSocial uses artificial intelligence technology, including large language models (powered by Anthropic's Claude AI) and image generation models, to assist in creating content. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content suggestions, captions, hashtags, calls-to-action, and images are generated by AI and should be reviewed by you before publishing</li>

          <li>You are the publisher of record for any content posted through the Service to your social media accounts, and you bear full responsibility for that content</li>
          <li>Some platforms, including TikTok, may require disclosure that content was AI-generated. You are responsible for complying with such requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Content Approval</h3>
