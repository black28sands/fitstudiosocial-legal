        <p>We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encryption in Transit</strong> — All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS)</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption at Rest</strong> — Database contents and stored files are encrypted at rest</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-Tenant Isolation</strong> — Each workspace (tenant) is isolated at the database query layer. Every database table includes a tenant identifier, and all queries are scoped to prevent cross-tenant data access</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication Security</strong> — Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms. JWT-based authentication with role-based access control protects API endpoints</li>
          <li><strong>Token Security</strong> — OAuth tokens for connected platforms are stored securely and are only accessed by authenticated, authorized backend processes</li>
          <li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong> — API rate limiting protects against abuse and unauthorized access attempts</li>
          <li><strong>Infrastructure Security</strong> — Our infrastructure uses containerized services with restricted network access</li>
        </ul>
